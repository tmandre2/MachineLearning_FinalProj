This was a project in my machine learning graduate course. 
The project was using ML methods in identifying cardiac risk 
given anonymized patient data. (E.g., age, sex, blood pressure, 
blood glucose, heartrate, pulse, etc)

*.pdf "Simultaneous Considerations..." discusses the data sets used. 
*.ipnyb Various ML methods used for comparison.
